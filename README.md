## How to run backend server

- You need to make a .env file first and give it the key PORT={anyValidPortNumber} (without the curly brackets ofc) and MONGO_URI={yourMongoDBAtlasClusterLink} we will discuss this later bs ghaleban i think we should all connect to the same cluster

- Inside /backend directory, run `npm install`

- Next, in the same directory run `nodemon app.ts`

- Open up `localhost:{anyValidPortNumber}` on your browser, and you should see an empty HTML page with the text "Backend Initialized!"

- Mabrook, now we can finally get to work
